Software automated testing is the process of evaluating and verifying if the software product or application does what it is supposed to do. It prevents bugs and reduces the development cost.

Unit testing is a part of the automated testing process in which small units of code are tested with several use cases for their reliability. A unit may be a function, method, class, state, or just a variable.
